# Uzuri is a new Angolan brand for products like lotion, exfoliating... everything related to skin.

The CEO of Uzuri is a family friend so she decided to give me the opportunity to show what I have learned by allowing me to do her website. 

The website is still in construction but so far that is how it looks like. 

I am using HTML/CSS, javascript, and bootstrap.
